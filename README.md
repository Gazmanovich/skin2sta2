# Skin2Sta2 (ex. Skin2StatueLive)
Small but powerful tool from [AxoSpyeyes](https://github.com/AxoSpyeyes/skin2sta2) to convert your skin file into a `.schem` file with blocks of the form **1.16.5**.
## How it's work?
- Replace the default `skininput.png` with your own skin of the same name;
- Launch `skintostatue.py`;
- When it's finished (if it's successful), the file `skin2sta2.schem` will appear in the same directory as `skintostatue.py`.
## How it's launch?
* Install [Pyton](https://www.python.org/);
* Install Visual code editor, like [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/);
* Install additional Python packages to work: [mcschematics](https://pypi.org/project/mcschematic/) and [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/);
* Launch `skintostatue.py` and run.
